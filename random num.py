#number guessing game - for thursday and friday

import random

n=random.randint(1,100)
print(n)

# write code to enter a number from user x

''' write code to check if n is smaller than x 
print appropriate message'''

''' write code to check if n is greater than x 
print appropriate message'''


''' write code to check if n is equal to x 
print appropriate message'''


''' make changes in the code so that it gives five turns to guess the number'''

'''make use of score variable to update score ; start with 100 score
subtract 10 from score each time guess is wrong
subtract 5 from score each time guess is +/- 5 
add 100 to score if it's a winn situation'''
#print score after every guess

'''research a bit more on 1) variation on random function
2) using other data type like lists to improve the efficiency of the gamne'''
